# Raid-Simulator
To Use: Download the .aia file and import to MIT App Inventor
## Description
Made with MIT App Inventor, this app was made for the discord bot/game IdleRPG in response to a new feature added.
Raid-Simulator simulates a group attack on a protected city and was used by my team in this game to decide
the best defense to use.

The way the raid/attack on a city works is that one team attacks a city with however many attackers sign up.
Each attacker has 250 HP and then their own respective attack and defense dependent on their equipment.
The city will have it's own base HP and defense, depending on the combination of 10 defensive buildings
set up in the city, dealing damage to an attacker based on the difference of the city's defense and the attacker's.
Every turn, the attackers collectively deal damage based on their total attack power on the city building with the most HP,
after which the city will randomly choose an attacker to attack, and it will only attack this attacker in the following turns 
until they are defeated. This turn cycle continues until all the attackers are defeated or all of the building in the city have
been destroyed.

This app simulates this following described raid with the user inputing the numberof attackers and their average attack and defense on the offensive side, and then inputting how many of each building the city will have on the defensive side. You then press to calculate button to see your city total HP and defense, and then the HP of each of your buildings after the attack if your city survive the simulation, paired with a message telling the user if the city survived or has been destroyed.

With this app, me and my team tested various attacker scenarios and decided on what the best defense to use for the longevity of the city we planned to occupy. With this, we were able to maintain a city that survived all attacks for months!
